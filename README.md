## Description


my-ford-benefits is a lightweight React application scaffold designed to demonstrate a simple expenses/benefits tracker UI and best-practice repo structure for contributors. This repository contains a ready-to-run React app with modular components for header, expense form, expense list, and receipts. The project emphasizes clean code, sensible defaults, and easy onboarding for contributors. It includes clear instructions for getting started, contribution guidelines, and a professional README to help new contributors and maintainers pick up the project quickly. The content and components are intentionally small and focused so you can expand them into a production-ready product, integrate real APIs, or use the structure for other internal tools and documentation.
